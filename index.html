            I am getting better everyday.

        <p class="motive">Time waste which you can do more by learning a skill or watching a TV Show
        </p>
        <p>Take this as 30 day challenge. I know you are the most willful person out there</p>
        <p class="motive">This feeling to distract will never go off. You should start living with it.
            Accept it and move on..
            And you will have so many distractions. So many people will try to stop you.

        <p>Dude if you are in Beta mode for one day, you are being in Beta mode for 24hrs.
            So try to be in Alpha mode only.
            If you are ever in Beta mode, stay there max for 30mins with a Timer on.
            Staying in Alpha Mode is better than regret of being in Beta mode for one day.
            Be an alpha ♾

            🧠 Final Thought
            “Sleep is the single most effective thing we can do to reset our brain and body health each day.”

            Walker’s message is clear: Prioritize sleep—it’s not a luxury, it’s a biological necessity.
